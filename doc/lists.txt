INTRODUCTION                                                      *lists-intro*

This is a Vim plugin to manage text based lists. The plugin is inactive by
default. It can be activated for a specific buffer with |:ListsEnable|. One
can also specify to auto enable for specific filetypes with
|g:lists_filetypes|.

The functionality was earlier a part of |wiki.vim| [0] and implemented for my
personal convenience. However, as someone pointed out [1], these features do
not really have anything to do with the wiki functionality of |wiki.vim|. It
is now therefore a separate plugin.

FEATURES                                                       *lists-features*

The following is a list of the commands and mappings provided by |lists.vim|.

*:ListsEnable*
  Load |lists.vim| for the current buffer.

  Note: This is the only global command. If |lists.vim| is not loaded, none of
        the other features are available.

*:ListsToggle*
*<plug>(lists-toggle)*
  Toggle a list item. The mapping works in both normal and insert mode.

*:ListsToggleBullet*
*<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-all)*
  Toggle the list bullet type between `-` and `*`. for the entire list.

*:ListsToggleBullet!*
*<plug>(lists-bullet-toggle-local)*
  Toggle the list bullet type between `-` and `*` for the sibling list
  entries.

*:ListsMoveUp*
*:ListsMoveDown*
*<plug>(lists-moveup)*
*<plug>(lists-movedown)*
  Move current list item up/down through a list.

*:ListsUniq*
*<plug>(lists-uniq)*
  Parse the current list and remove repeated entries recursively.

*:ListsUniqLocal*
*<plug>(lists-uniq-local)*
  Similar to |:ListsUniq|, but only within the current list depth.

*<plug>(lists-al)*
*<plug>(lists-il)*
  Text object for list items. The inner object is the current list item
  including children, the outer object is the parent list item including all
  its children.
  The following mappings are available as visual mode and operator mode
  mappings, i.e. |xmap| and |omap|.

The default mappings are listed in the following table. The map mode is
indicated by the first letters of the various map commands (|nmap|, |imap|,
|omap|, and |xmap|).
